**This document is formatted with headers for each of the assignment
requirements. You should be able to pick out the section you’re grading.
Thanks!!**

The purpose of the run\_analysis.r script is to use provided datasets to
create an table of the mean of summary statistics for smartphone
accelerometer observations by subject and activity type. The following
columns are included:

-   SUBJECT — Integer Factor, 1 to 30. The number assigned to a specific
    smartphone from which observations were taken.
-   ACTIVITY — String Factor. The motion activity being performed at the
    time of the observation
    -   WALKING
    -   WALKING\_UPSTAIRS
    -   WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS
    -   SITTING
    -   STANDING
    -   LAYING
-   NUMBERED SUMMARY STATISTICS (remaining columns) — Double, -1 to 1.
    Average of each variable for a given SUBJECT and ACTIVITY. These
    variables represent a summary statistic (mean or standard deviation)
    related to standardized and normalized measurements from a
    smartphone accelerometer at the time of observation.

Downloading Data
----------------

Data for this set was downloaded as a zip file from
<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" class="uri">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a>

This zip file contains observations from the accelerometers of 30
Samsung Galaxy S smartphones during six different motion activities.

The following files were used to compose this dataset:

The files were downloaded and stored in a folder in the working
directory.

Requirement \#1 - Merge the training and test sets
--------------------------------------------------

The following packages were loaded for use in the analysis:

    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    library(readr)

Then, each text file was read into an r tibble variable using
read\_table from the dplyr package. No files contained column names, so
the col\_names option was set to false:

    subject_test<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    X_test<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    Y_test<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    subject_train<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    X_train<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    Y_train<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    activity_labels<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col_names=FALSE)
    features<-read_table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col_names=FALSE)

After reading in the data, the tibbles were formatted for a clean merge.
The merge command rearranges the observations included in each dataset,
so much of the pre-processing occurs before the merge.

First, activities in Y\_test and Y\_train were bound to the
corresponding observations in X\_test and X\_train, respectively, and
the column was named “Activity” in both tibbles:

    colnames(Y_test)<-"Activity"
    colnames(Y_train)<-"Activity"
    X_test<-tbl_df(cbind(Y_test,X_test))
    X_train<-tbl_df(cbind(Y_train,X_train))

Then, the corresponding subject from subject\_test and subject\_trained
were bound to each observation in X\_test and X\_train, and the column
named “Subject”:

    colnames(subject_test)<-"Subject"
    colnames(subject_train)<-"Subject"
    X_test<-tbl_df(cbind(subject_test,X_test))
    X_train<-tbl_df(cbind(subject_train,X_train))

Prior to the merge, a column (Observation\_Type) was added to each
dataset using dplyr’s mutate function with a string corresponding to
which of the observation files the observation came from. “Test” was
used for observations in X\_test and “Train” was used for observations
in X\_train. This column was included to allow for later decomposition
of the dataset if necessary:

    X_test<-mutate(X_test,Observation_Type = "Test")
    dim(X_test)

    ## [1] 2947  564

    X_train<-mutate(X_train,Observation_Type = "Train")
    dim(X_train)

    ## [1] 7352  564

Then, with each tibble formatted the same way, the X\_test and X\_train
tibbles were merged into a single tibble called X\_set using option
all=TRUE to preserve all observations from both tables:

    X_set<-tbl_df(merge(X_test,X_train,all=TRUE))
    dim(X_set)

    ## [1] 10299   564

**This fulfills assignment criteria \#1**

Requirement \#4 - Descriptive variable names
--------------------------------------------

Following the merge, a few cleanup operations were performed. First,
column names were added to the X\_set using already defined column names
and a character vector made up of the column from the features tibble:

    colnames(X_set)<-c("Subject","Activity",unlist(features[,1]),"Observation_Type")

**This fulfills assignment criteria \#4**

Requirement \#3 - Descriptive activity names
--------------------------------------------

Then, the “Subject”, “Activity”, and “Observation\_Type” columns were
converted into factors from double, double, and character, respectively:

    X_set<-mutate(X_set,Subject=as.factor(Subject),Activity=as.factor(Activity), Observation_Type=as.factor(Observation_Type))

Finally, the factor numbers in the “Activity” column were replaced with
the corresponding text from the activity\_lables tibble:

    levels(X_set$Activity)<-unlist(activity_labels[,2])

**This fulfills assignment criteria \#3**

The result is a fully merged dataset with descriptive variable names and
activity names (requirements 1, 3, and 4).

Requirement \#2 - Select only certain columns
---------------------------------------------

To create the final product, only the factor variable columns, as well
as those containing the mean and standard deviation of individual
observations are needed. The mean and standard deviation columns all end
in either “mean()” or “std()”. A select function was performed to gather
the factor variables (excluding Observation\_Type), and any columns
containing “mean()” or “std()”, bringing the total number of columns
from 564 to 68:

    X_agg<-select(X_set,Subject,Activity,contains("mean()"),contains("std()"))
    dim(X_agg)

    ## [1] 10299    68

**This fulfills assignment criteria \#3**

Requirement \#5 - Create a second dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the final dataset, the aggregated set from the previous step
was grouped by subject and activity, then the summarize\_all function in
dplyr was used to find the mean of all non-grouped variables:

    Summary_Set<-group_by(X_agg,Subject,Activity) %>% summarize_all(funs(mean))

    ## Warning: funs() is soft deprecated as of dplyr 0.8.0
    ## Please use a list of either functions or lambdas: 
    ## 
    ##   # Simple named list: 
    ##   list(mean = mean, median = median)
    ## 
    ##   # Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: 
    ##   tibble::lst(mean, median)
    ## 
    ##   # Using lambdas
    ##   list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.
